# Overview
Welcome to our final project for the class. 

# Box Directories
The box link is here: [https://vanderbilt.box.com/s/1e68em60i4kpo0g4dxvxyd6j8cwvv2p7](https://vanderbilt.box.com/s/1e68em60i4kpo0g4dxvxyd6j8cwvv2p7). This is because it's just too big for github. This is basically all the code that didn't make it into an external repo for the other assignments.
Overview of the directories:
1. closed_loop_simulation - Controller and dockerfile and analysis for the closed loop simulation.
2. open_loop_simulation - Controller and dockerfile and analysis for the open loop simulation.
3. real_world_test_bag_analysis - How we generated the communication plot from the toyota and honda bag files.
4. deployed_controller - the controller that is compiled and stored in the cs3891-controller github repo.
5. wave_detection.zip - Includes our wave detection code in the appendix.

# External relevant repos:
1. [https://github.com/AlexOSAdventurer/cs3861-baseline](https://github.com/AlexOSAdventurer/cs3861-baseline) - The libpanda app that is installed and uses the controller. Called baseline because we naively thought of it as a "baseline" libpanda app and then proceeded to do our whole project in it.
2. [https://github.com/AlexOSAdventurer/cs3891-controller](https://github.com/AlexOSAdventurer/cs3891-controller) - The compiled controller.
3. [https://github.com/jmscslgroup/ransom-server-site/tree/main/junyi_musketeer_project](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/ransom-server-site/tree/main/junyi_musketeer_project) - Ransom server backend.
4. [https://github.com/jmscslgroup/libpanda/tree/nov-2023-junyi-class](https://github.com/jmscslgroup/libpanda/tree/nov-2023-junyi-class) - Relevant libpanda branch.
